# count.sh makes distributing points easier.
# Fill your feedback with things as -4 to subtract points. Run count.sh to
# automatically calculate the rest of the points:
#   TOTAL=100 ./count.sh s*/s*.txt
# 100 points is the default.

# count.sh updates the Current Grade line (even when it does not say 'Needs
# Grading'!) and adds a 'Points: ...' line at the end of the feedback with the
# calculation. The script can be run multiple times; the old calculation will
# be overridden. Do not write stuff below the calculation as the script will
# just remove the last three lines.

# This does not work with decimal numbers.
# + is not recognised for bonus points, but do make a pull request.

# The regex to recognise points is \s\-\d+, so include whitespace before it.
